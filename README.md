###### This my first hands-on experience with machine learning, I have done my Capstone Project on Wine Quality Prediction and another assignment on Placement Prediction.

### Wine Quality Prediction
####### I have imported the dataset of a red wine which contains information on:
1.fixed acidity
2.volatile acidity
3.citric acid
4.residual sugar
5.chlorides
6.free sulfur dioxide
7.total sulfur dioxide
8.density
9.pH
10.sulphates
11.alcohol
I use these features to predict the quality of the red wine
